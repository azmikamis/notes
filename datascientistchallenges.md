### Challenges after creating model
- Load model with weights
- Preprocess data
- Serve trained models for inference
- Handle prediction response data
- Enable distributed data storage and streaming
- Use ML frameworks to set up distributed training
- Manage trained models and metadata
### Questions
- Queries per second (QPS), latency
- How to evaluate model in production
- How frequent to re-train model
- What are data preprocessing needs
- [Training-serving skew](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/#training-serving_skew)
- Need to run offline
